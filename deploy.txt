Instruction to deploy a fullstack web app(Mongodb + Express + React + Node).
We are going to use Heroku.

Basically there are two way of deploying any web app to the server.
1. Manually build the complete app and place it in "build" folder inside client folder(for react applications)
   and later upload to the server.
   for testing go inside client and execute "npm run build".

2. Write a post script that will build the application and will put in "build" folder and will upload to the server.
	"Building the application" is nothing, it's actually making a complied version file of our application which is not human readable and that file is going to be uploaded.

NOTE: Inside the build folder a "index.html" file will be created automatically after compition of build process.
	  And our main target is to execute the "index.html" file.

Here we are going to use 2nd method.
Steps:
	1. go to the server.js file and write some scripts that will serve our static assets in production.
	2. add few scripts //see server.js line 35.
	3. write a post build script in node server's package.json file(not in client folder).
	4. download heroku CLI software if don't have.
	5. inside root directory execute following cmd:
		a. heroku login
		b. enter email and password
		c. heroku create //creating an app
		d. git add .
		e. git commit -am 'version 1.0'
		f. heroku git:remote -a secure-cove-37756 // get this from your heroku dashboard
		g. git push heroku master
